    <string name="Passage1Text1">
        The largest of the five Great Lakes of North Amerika is Lake Superior. It is <b><i>situated</i></b> on the northern edge of Wisconsin and stretches between the Upper Penisula og Michigan north to Ontario Canada, and spans west
        to the eastern edge of Minnesota. The lake stretches appoximately 350 miles from west to east, and 160 miles north to south, with a shoreline almost 2800 miles long. That is the same distance as travling
        from Duluth Minnesota to Miami Florida.
    </string>

    <string name="Passage1Text2">
        Not onle is Lake Superior the largest of the five Great Lakes, itu also has the largest surface area of any freshwater lake in the world. It has a surface area of 31.820 square mile (82.413 squere kilometer) which is approximately
        the size of South Carolina. The lake contains almost 3.0000 cubic miles of water, an amount that could fill all the other Great Lakes plus three additional Lake Eries. With an avarege depth approaching 500 feet,
        Lake Superior is also the cooldest and deepest (1.332 feet) of the Great Lakes. It has a maximum length of 350 miles (563 KM) and maximum breadth of 160 miles (257 KM), It averege depth is 482 feet (147 KM) with a maximum depth
        of 1.332 feet (406 m). The amount of water in Lake Superior can cover the <b><i>entire</i></b> land mass of North and South America with 1 foot (30 cm) of water. It is shoreline stretches 2.726 miles (4.387 KM).
           </string>

    <string name="Passage1Text3">
        Based on a study by professors at the University of Mineesota Duluth, Lake Superior may have warmed faster than its surronding climate. The surface temperatures of the lake in the summer appeared to have increased
        by about 4.5 Fahrenheit (2.5 Celcius) since 1979, compared with an approximately 2.7 Fahrenheit (1.5 Celcius) increaase in the surronding averege air temperature. The increase in the lakes surface temperature may be
        relation to the decreasing ice cover. Less winter ice cover allows more solar radiation to penetrate the lake and warm the water.
           </string>
    <string name="Passage1Text4">
        The averege surface elevation of Lake Superior is 600 feet (183 m) above sea level. The current water levels, including diversions of water from the Hudson Bay watershed, are governed by the international Lake Superior
        Board of Control which was estabilished in 1914 by the International Joint Commission. Its water levels temporarily reached <b><i>a new low</i></b> in September 2007, slightly less than previous record low in 1926. However, the water levels
        returned within a several days.

    <string name="Passage2Text1">
        Like the Spanish influence on America architecture during the Spanish colonial era, the English influence on America architecture can be clearly seen. The first permanent English speaking settlement in the USA was
        Jamestown, Virginia, which was founded in 1607. the excavations at this region have unearthed part of the triangular James Fort and numerous artifact from the early 17th century. Virginia\'s colonial capital was nearby
        Williamsburg, a <b><i>well-preserved</i></b> 18th century town, which now becomes a tourist attraction.
    </string>

    <string name="Passage2Text2">
        Ninety percent of the New World population of 200.000 in 16577 drew from England. The English settlers used the same simple construction techniques as those in their respective <b><i>mother</i></b> countries. These settler often
        came to the New World for economic reasons. It reveals why most early homes reflect the influence of modest village homes and small farms. The appearance of structures was very plain and made with little imported
        material. Windows, for example, were very small. <b><i>Their</i></b> size did not increased until long after even the British were manufacting glass. This was because the Venetians had not rediscovered the stricly Roman clear glass
        until the fifteenth century and it did not come to England until another hundred years later. The few windows that did exist on early colonial homes had small panes held together by a lead framework, much like a typical
        church\'s stained glass window. The glass used was imported from England and was incredibly expensive. In the 18th century, many of these houses were restored and sash windows replaced the Originals. These were invented
        by Robert Hooke (1635-1703) and were made so that one panel of glass easily slid up, vertically, behind another.
    </string>

    <string name="Passage2Text3">
        Many houses were made of wood because timber was readily <b><i>abundant</i></b> for the settlers in America. As for decorative elements, there were very few notable efforts made to show creativity with the early colonial homes,
        and if an effort was made, it led to a very simple outcome. A subtle element of ornamentation was made on the front door. The owner would take nails, think of an object or pattern to make with them, and nail that decoration
        onto the door. The ore nails one had, the more extravagant and elaborate the pattern could become.

    <string name="Passage2Text4">
        The chimney, usually made of brick or stone, was very fashionable especially during 1600 - 1715. Coal was the popular material for heating the home during the Tudor period in England, which lasted up until around
        1603. Before that, a wood fire was burned on the floor in the center of the house, with the smoke escaping only through windows and vents.

        Barter is a system of exchange by which goods or services without using money. The barter system dates back many countries. In most countries or regions the barter system was used before money was created. People
        having specific goods or services to sell would exchange them with others for the things <b><i>they</i></b> needed. Barter also replaces money as the system of exchange in times of monetery crisis, such as when currency may be either
        <b><i>unstable</i></b> or simply unavailable for conduction commerce. Since money value in value from country to country, bartering is easy to do anywhere in the world. Explorers and pilgrims used the barter system to get the things
        they needed for their journeys. For instance, explorers exchanged their good for spices that were not available where they came from.
    </string>

    <string name="Passage3Text2">
        In today\'s economy it is sometimes easier to exchange goods or services for other goods or services. What makes the barter system even better today than even before is that it can now be done globally. In the Past
        bartering was simply done with those that were located nearby. If the family raised chickens, they traded chickens or eggs from items they needed such as cloth with which to make clothing.
    </string>

    <string name="Passage3Text3">
        Nowaday the barter system can be used in a much more <b><i>sophisticated</i></b> way than ever before. However, it carries with it the same basic purpose - exchange of goods or services for other goods or services. the barter system
        allows someone to negotiate the wroth of his or her goods or services in connection with the goods or services that other people want. Bartering allows people to get the things they needed without having expend additional money.
        Instead thay can use the goods they no longer need or want to get the things they do need. There are swap markets and online auctions that allow them to sell or trade their goods or to <b><i>purchase</i></b> goods that they need or want.
        Negotiation is done just like it was hundreds of year before.

        The human brain is divided in half, a right and left hemisphere. The right hemisphere <b><i>deal with</i></b> visual activities and plays a role in putting things together. For example, it takes visual information, puts it together,
        and says \'I recognize that - that is a car\', or \'That is a book\', or \'That is a bus\'. It recognize or groups information together. The left hemisphere tends to be the more analytical part; it analyze information
        collected by the right hemisphere. it takes information from the right hemisphere \'sees\' a car, but the leeft hemisphere says, \'Oh yeah, I know whose car that is - it is John\' car\'.
